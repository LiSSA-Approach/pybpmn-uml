# Example dataset

The to be converted UML class diagram images and corresponding annotations need to have the same structure as this example dataset in order to convert them into a COCO dataset.

.uml-dataset stores images and corresponding annotations made with [UML image annotator](https://github.com/LiSSA-Approach/uml-image-annotator).
It also stores the split from filename to (train, test, val).

.coco is the target directory for the COCO dataset that is created after execution.
